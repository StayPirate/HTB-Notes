- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  It's well known to extract plain-text passwords, hash, PIN code and kerberos tickets from memory. It can also perform pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket or build Golden tickets.
  #+END_NOTE
- Official [repository](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz).
- Official [wiki](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki), additional [docs](https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821).
- Download binaries ðŸ’¾ from official [releases](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases), also maintained in [Kali](https://www.kali.org/tools/mimikatz/) at `/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/`.
- Evade detection
	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  Due to the mainstream popularity of Mimikatz and well-known detection signatures, consider avoiding using it as a standalone application and use antivirus evasion techniques instead.
	  #+END_IMPORTANT
		- Execute Mimikatz directly from memory using an [injector](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1) like PowerShell.
		- Use other tools [to dump](https://www.whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/attacks-defenses-dumping-lsass-no-mimikatz/) the entire LSASS process memory.
			- Built-in Task Manager (GUI)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [Procdump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [[CrackMapExec]] (`--lsa`)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [Lsassy](https://github.com/Hackndo/lsassy)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Then process the dump in a secure machine
				- From a trusted Windows machine with Mimikatz
				  ```cmd
				  sekurlsa::minidump lsass.DMP
				  log lsass.txt
				  sekurlsa::logonPasswords
				  ```
				- From a trusted Linux machine with [Pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz)
				  
				  ```bash
				  pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP
				  ```
- To extract sensible data from the `lsass` process' memory the [`sekurlsa`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-~-sekurlsa) module can be used. In order to properly work it requires one of the following accounts/permissions.
	- Administrator user. In this case you need to get `debug` privilege via `privilege::debug`.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- SYSTEM account. In this case `debug` privilege is not needed.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Plain-text password in Mimikatz output
	- Sometimes Mimikatz returns plain-text passwords instead of their hashes, this is because [WDigest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc778868(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) is enabled.
	- That's the case of older operating systems like Windows 7, or operating systems where Wdigest has been manually enabled.
- Abusing TGT and service tickets
	- A different approach and use of Mimikatz is to exploit Kerberos authentication by abusing [*TGT*](((655a1fb1-47f5-446a-8813-e1a809f05a7b))) and [*service tickets*](((655b6438-ee0f-4168-8a40-754613d2b793))). As [mentioned here](((655a2173-161c-473c-bb1f-f4f6ee9aa3d9))), *TGT* and *service tickets* for users currently logged on to the local machine are stored for future use. These tickets are also stored in LSASS, and we can use Mimikatz to interact with and retrieve our own tickets as well as the tickets of other local users.
		- id:: 655b726e-0d43-4563-8113-26fa050e7731
		  #+BEGIN_CENTER
		  SILVER TICKET
		  #+END_CENTER 
		  #+BEGIN_CAUTION
		  Stealing a [**TGS**](((655b6438-aa29-434b-bdf9-75e172e85fd1))) would allow us to access only particular resources associated with those tickets.
		  #+END_CAUTION
		- id:: 655b7297-4e11-496a-be73-935b85edd3bb
		  #+BEGIN_CENTER
		  GOLDEN TICKET
		  #+END_CENTER 
		  #+BEGIN_CAUTION
		  Stealing a [**TGT**](((655a4269-a509-429f-95ea-ce8b6582cf9c))) would allow us to  request a TGS for specific resources we want to target within the domain. It can use to forge arbitrary TGS.
		  #+END_CAUTION
	- To dump tickets from LSASS process memory we can use the [`sekurlsa::tickets`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-~-sekurlsa#tickets) command.
	  ```
	  sekurlsa::tickets
	  ```
- Certificates
  id:: 655b7624-0ef9-481b-96a1-2aa762c3f0dd
	- Certificates' private keys are also stored in the LSASS process' memory. As [mentioned here](((655b76db-6fdf-470e-9bea-1d662dcfd6c1))), certificates may be marked as having a non-exportable private key.
	- The [`crypto`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-~-crypto) module provides capability to either patch the [CryptoAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptoapi-system-architecture) function with [`crypto::capi`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-~-crypto#capi) or the [KeyIso service](http://revertservice.com/10/keyiso/) with [`crypto::cng`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-~-crypto#cng), **making non-exportable keys exportable**.
- Defeating Mimikatz
	- Windows Defender Credential Guard
		- [Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) is a security feature that was introduced by Microsoft in **Windows  10 Enterprise** and **Windows Server 2016**. Credential Guard utilizes virtualization-based security and isolated memory management to ensure that only privileged system software can access domain credentials.
		- Once enabled Windows servers and devices in your domain can **no longer use legacy authentication** protocols such as NTLMv1, Digest, CredSSP and MS-CHAPv2, nor can they use Kerberos unconstrained delegation and DES Encryption.
		- According to Mimikatz's author, even though isolated LSAs canâ€™t be queried, Mimikatz can still capture the credentials being entered. If you have control of an endpoint and a privileged user logs in, then it is possible to get the credentials and elevate privileges.
			- {{twitter https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/1044715664823308289}}
		- Starting in Windows 11 version 22H2, VBS *(virtualization-based security)* and Credential Guard are enabled by default on all devices that meet the system requirements. Credential Guard is supported on 64-bit Secure Boot devices only.
	- LSA Protection
		- Starting with *Windows 8.1* and *Windows Server 2012 R2* or later, added protection for the LSA is provided to **prevent reading memory and code injection** by nonprotected processes.
		- Since Windows 11 it's enabled by default.
	- Starting with Windows 8.x and 10, by default, there is no password in memory. Exceptions are:
		- When the DC is unreachable, the kerberos provider keeps passwords for future negotiation.
		- When `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest`, `UseLogonCredential` *(DWORD)* is set to `1`, the wdigest provider keeps passwords.
		- When values in `Allow*` in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Credssp\PolicyDefaults` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CredentialsDelegation`, the CredSSP provider (`tspkgs`) keeps passwords.
