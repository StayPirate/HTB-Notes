- Active Directory (AD) is a database and set of services that connect users with the network resources they need to get their work done.
	- The **Active Directory** database (directory) contains information about the AD objects in the domain. Common types of AD objects include:
		- Users
		- Groups
		- Computers
		- Applications
		- Printers
		- Shared Folders
	- The **Domain Controller** is a server that provides all the services needed for managing activities occurring in your IT environment. In particular, it makes sure each person is who they claim to be (*authentication*) and allow them to access only the data theyâ€™re allowed to use (*authorization*).
- Service Principal Name ([SPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names))

	- SPN is a concept from [[Kerberos]]. It's an identifier for a particular service offered by a particular host within an authentication domain.
	- It's assigned to application instance when they are registered in the Active Directory ("Kerberized" service). This also allows for easy management for administrators and gets a better integration with other AD objects and services.
	- [[Kerberos]] uses SPNs to associate a service instance with a service account, usually the AD computer account.
		- If a SPN is associated to an **AD user account**, then the [[Kerberoasting]] attack can be execute attempting to retrieve the user's password.
		- For computer accounts, [managed service accounts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009), and [group-managed service accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview) the password is randomly generated, complex, and 120 characters long, **making cracking infeasible**.

	- The SPN consists of a string on the form of: `service class`/`fqdn`@`REALM`.
		- The `service class` can loosely be thought of as the protocol for the service.
			- The list of service classes that are built-in to Windows are [listed here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#service-principal-names).
		- The `fqdn` is the *fully qualified domain name* of the computer hosting the service.
		- `REALM` is a Kerberos term to refer what in AD is called *domain*
		- Example: `IMAP/mail.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM`
- User Principal Name (UPN)
	- Similar to the SPN but for user objects
- Find the Primary Domain Controller
	- Within a domain there might be multiple DCs. In  that case the *domain name* could potentially resolve to the IP address of any of them.
	  
	  To make our enumeration as accurate as possible, we should look for the DC that
	  holds the most updated information. This is known as the [*Primary Domain Controller* (PDC)](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/active-directory-introduction-and-enumeration/active-directory-manual-enumeration/enumerating-active-directory-using-powershell-and-net-classes#fn6). There can be only one PDC in a domain. To find the PDC, we need to find the DC holding the ***PdcRoleOwner*** property.
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
	  ```
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
	  
	  Forest                  : corp.com
	  DomainControllers       : {DC1.corp.com}
	  Children                : {}
	  DomainMode              : Unknown
	  DomainModeLevel         : 7
	  Parent                  :
	  PdcRoleOwner			: DC1.corp.com
	  RidRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
	  InfrastructureRoleOwner : DC1.corp.com
	  Name                  	: corp.com
	  ```
	  Only return the PDC:
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
	  DC1.corp.com
	  ```
