- The **[Domain Controller](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc786438(v=ws.10))** is a server that provides all the services needed for managing activities occurring in your IT environment. In particular, it makes sure each person is who they claim to be (*authentication*) and allow them to access only the data theyâ€™re allowed to use (*authorization*). There are several services running on it, like:
  id:: 65a7a0b2-f9d2-436b-b4f2-369427fa7489
	- The **AD** *([Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview))*, it is a database (directory) holding information about AD objects in the domain. Common types of AD objects include: User, Groups, Computers, Applications, Printers, Shared folders.
	  id:: 65a7a0b2-a866-414f-b6af-04542a7e6656
	- The **KDC** *([Key Distribution Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/key-distribution-center))* holds a database of the keys used in the authentication process and consists of two main parts:
	  id:: 6565b3f7-61b6-4b2a-a59d-01d20e6acd96
		- The  *Authentication Service* (AS) responsible for authenticating clients and issuing [TGT](((655b1bc6-5c5d-4c70-9d2b-f3f3d6458cb9)))s.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The *Ticket Granting Service* (TGS) issues [tickets](((655a24c7-b91e-4a45-8468-c565395f566e))) for connection to computers in its own domain.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- According to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/key-distribution-center), KDC and AD are located on the domain controller. Both services are started automatically by the domain controller's *Local Security Authority* (LSA) and run as part of the LSA's process.

- Principal Names
	- In [[Kerberos]], a principal name is a unique identifier for a network entity, such as a *user* or *service*, that participates in Kerberos authentication and authorization.
	- Service Principal Name ([SPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) or *sname*)
	  id:: 655e0fad-5b48-42ce-b82a-09cd0e4a9322
		- Identifies a particular service offered by a particular host within a domain and it's assigned to application instances when they are registered in the Active Directory *(Kerberized services)*.
		- The *SPN identity* is a domain user account that has been mapped to the SPN. This mapping allows the KDC to identify which Kerberos keys should be used in the communication.
			- If a SPN is associated to a **domain user account**, then the [[Kerberoasting]] attack can be execute attempting to retrieve the user's password.
			- For computer accounts, [managed service accounts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009), and [group-managed service accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview) the password is randomly generated, complex, and 120 characters long, **making cracking infeasible**.
			  id:: 655e3185-f921-4b07-bb00-e397a2486fc6
		- The SPN consists of a string on the form of: `service class`/`fqdn`@`REALM`.
			- The `service class` can loosely be thought of as the protocol for the service.
				- The list of service classes that are built-in to Windows are [listed here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772815(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#service-principal-names).
			- The `fqdn` is the *[fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)* of the computer hosting the service.
			- `REALM` is a Kerberos term to refer what in AD-world is called *domain*
			- Examples:
				- IMAP/mail.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
				- HTTP/web.hpbank.local
				- MSSQLSvc/MSSQL01.hpbank.local
				- CIFS/DC01.hpbank.local
	- User Principal Name (UPN or *cname*)
		- Similar to the SPN but for user objects
- Security Principals
  id:: 65ae443c-68a0-4b2e-b534-b7cf8934ec14
	- A Windows security principal is an authenticated entity, like a **user**, **computer**, or **group of users** or **computers**. Each security principal has a unique identifier that's known as a SID.
	- Security Identifiers (SID)
	  id:: 65ae6139-ddd3-44a1-906e-f0302a9151e7
		- A security identifier is used to uniquely identify a *security principal* or *security group*.
		- The system authority (*[Local Security Authority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection)* for local entities, or *[DC](((65a7a0b2-f9d2-436b-b4f2-369427fa7489)))* for domain ones), generates the SID that identifies a particular account or group at the time the account or group is created. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it can never be used again to identify another user or group.
		- SID Architecture
			- A security identifier is a binary data structure that contains a variable number of values in the form of `S-R-X-Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn`.
				- `S` is a literal which indicates that the string is a SID.
				- `R` is the revision number and is **always set to 1**.
				- `X` identifies the highest level of authority that can issue SIDs for a particular type of security principal.
					- `1` is the *World Authority*.
					- `5` specifies the *NT Authority* and is used for local or domain users and groups. This is the most common authority value.
				- `Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn` represents the most important information in a SID, which is contained in a series of one or more **subauthority** values.
					- `Y1-Y2-Yn-1` is the the **domain identifier** and can identify a domain in an enterprise.
						- `domainidentifier` is the SID of the domain for domain users.
						- `rootdomainidentifier` is the SID of the forest root domain.
						- `localmachine` is the SID of the local machine for local users.
						- `32` for built-in principals.
					- `Yn` is the **Relative Identifier** (RID) and identifies a particular account or group relative to a domain.
			- SID Examples
				- The SID for a **local user** on a Windows system is
				  `S-1-5-21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058-1001`
					- `21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058` are the sub-authorities of the identifier authority.
					- `1001` is the user RID
						- Because the RID starts at 1000 for nearly all principals, this implies that this is the second local user created on the system.
				- The SID of the [built-in Administrator group](((65ae5e3a-c0ae-412c-8fe8-932a85560b17))) is `S-1-5-32-544`
					- `1` is the revision level
					- `5` is the identifier authority value (NT Authority)
					- `32` is the domain identifier (built-in principals)
					- `544` is the relative identifier (RID) for the Administrator group
				- The SID for the global [Domain Admins](((65ae5d70-a04c-448e-98c0-5bfe849f1172))) group for a specific domain is
				  `S-1-5-21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330-512`
					- `1` is the revision level
					- `5` is the identifier authority value (NT Authority)
					- `21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330` is the domain identifier
					- `512` is the relative identifier (RID) for the Domain Admins group
		- [Well](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/well-known-sids)-[known](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers) Security Identifiers
			- Well-known SIDs are default built-in entities in Windows used to identify generic groups and users. These SIDs have values that remain constant across all operating systems, and the RID is lower than 1000.

- Find the Primary Domain Controller
	- Within a domain there might be multiple DCs. In  that case the *domain name* could potentially resolve to the IP address of any of them.
	  
	  To make our enumeration as accurate as possible, we should look for the DC that
	  holds the most updated information. This is known as the [*Primary Domain Controller* (PDC)](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/active-directory-introduction-and-enumeration/active-directory-manual-enumeration/enumerating-active-directory-using-powershell-and-net-classes#fn6). There can be only one PDC in a domain. To find the PDC, we need to find the DC holding the ***PdcRoleOwner*** property.
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
	  ```
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
	  
	  Forest                  : corp.com
	  DomainControllers       : {DC1.corp.com}
	  Children                : {}
	  DomainMode              : Unknown
	  DomainModeLevel         : 7
	  Parent                  :
	  PdcRoleOwner			: DC1.corp.com
	  RidRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
	  InfrastructureRoleOwner : DC1.corp.com
	  Name                  	: corp.com
	  ```
	  Only return the PDC:
	  ```powershell
	  PS C:\> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
	  DC1.corp.com
	  ```
